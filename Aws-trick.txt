You can use the AWS CLI to save tons of time by combining commands into one-liners — for example, to see which S3 buckets are taking up the most space, run aws s3 ls | awk '{print $3}' | while read bucket; do echo -n "$bucket: "; aws s3 ls s3://$bucket --recursive --human-readable --summarize | grep "Total Size"; done, which lists all buckets and their total sizes without opening the console, and for real-time debugging of Lambda or EC2 logs, you can tail them directly using aws logs tail /aws/lambda/your-lambda-name --follow, letting you stream logs live; combining such commands lets you automate storage checks, monitoring, and quick debugging entirely from the terminal, making DevOps much faster and cleaner.
